Gem or Scam

Gem or Scam is a platform where you can rate cryptocurrencies as either a gem or scam.
Regular users will be promoted to author when they successfully rate 3 different cryptocurrencies.
They can then upload their own cryptocurrency which other users can rate, but first an administrator has
to accept your cryptocurrency. 
You can also search the cryptocurrencies you like with the search function or filter on classification.
